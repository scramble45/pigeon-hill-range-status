flatpak install flathub com.github.scramble45.PigeonHillRangeStatus

# Run the application
flatpak run com.github.scramble45.PigeonHillRangeStatus
```

### Option 2: Build from Source

#### Prerequisites
- Qt6 development libraries
- C++17 compatible compiler
- pkg-config

**Ubuntu/Debian:**
```bash
sudo apt install qt6-base-dev qt6-base-private-dev libqt6network6-dev build-essential pkg-config
```

**Fedora:**
```bash
sudo dnf install qt6-qtbase-devel qt6-qtnetwork-devel gcc-c++ pkgconfig
```

**Arch Linux:**
```bash
sudo pacman -S qt6-base qt6-networkauth gcc pkgconf
```

#### Build and Install
```bash
git clone https://github.com/scramble45/pigeon-hill-range-status.git
cd pigeon-hill-range-status
make
make install
```

The application will be installed to `~/.local/bin/pigeon-hill-range-status`.

### Option 3: Manual Build

```bash
# Generate moc file
/usr/lib/qt6/moc pigeon-hill-range-status.cpp -o pigeon-hill-range-status.moc

# Compile
g++ -std=c++17 -Wall -O2 -fPIC \
    $(pkg-config --cflags Qt6Core Qt6Widgets Qt6Network) \
    -Wl,--no-undefined \
    -o pigeon-hill-range-status \
    pigeon-hill-range-status.cpp \
    $(pkg-config --libs Qt6Core Qt6Widgets Qt6Network)
```

## Usage

### Starting the Application
```bash
pigeon-hill-range-status
```

The application will start minimized to the system tray. Look for the icon in your system tray area.

### System Tray Interactions
- **Left Click** - Show tooltip with current status and last check time
- **Middle Click** - Force immediate status check
- **Right Click** - Open context menu

### Auto-start on Login
To start automatically when you log in, create a desktop entry:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/autostart
cat > ~/.config/autostart/pigeon-hill-range-status.desktop << EOF
[Desktop Entry]
Type=Application
Name=Pigeon Hill Range Status
Exec=$HOME/.local/bin/pigeon-hill-range-status
Hidden=false
NoDisplay=false
X-GNOME-Autostart-enabled=true
EOF
```

## How It Works

The application monitors the [Pigeon Hill Conservation Area webpage](https://mdc.mo.gov/discover-nature/places/pigeon-hill-conservation-area) for closure alerts. The Missouri Department of Conservation posts red alert banners when the range is closed for maintenance, hunting seasons, or other reasons.

**Status Detection Logic:**
- ðŸŸ¢ **OPEN** - No closure alerts found on the webpage
- ðŸ”´ **CLOSED** - Alert banner contains keywords like "closed", "closure", or "prohibited"
- âšª **UNKNOWN** - Network error or unable to parse webpage

## Configuration

Currently, the application uses hardcoded settings:
- **Check Interval**: 2 hours
- **Website URL**: MDC Pigeon Hill Conservation Area page
- **Timeout**: Standard Qt network timeout

Future versions may include a configuration file for customization for additional ranges.
